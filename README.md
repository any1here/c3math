# C3 Maths Library
This library houses my custom implementations of math functions and structs
## features
- [ ] matrix module (`~90%`)
- [ ] quaternion module
##### (others planned in the future)
---
## benchmarking
`main.c3` currently only houses matrix benchmarks. Build the project with `c3c build`, and for general benchmarks run the program WITHOUT args.

If you want to test a specific size of matrices (e.x. 2x2 matrices) change the `SIZE` constant in `main.c3`, build again, and run the program WITH args.
