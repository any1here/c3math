# C3 Maths Library
This library houses my custom implementations of math functions and structs, which would be considered for merging into the C3 stdlib.
## Features
- [X] matrix module
##### (others planned in the future, open PRs for new ones you would like to see)
---
## Testing
Run `c3c test` to test virtually (and hopefully) ALL features in this library.
## Benchmarking
Run `c3c bench` to benchmark every function as well.
### Known issues:
- Benchmarking broken
- Codegen takes too long
